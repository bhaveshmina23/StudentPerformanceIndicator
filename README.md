### 1) Problem statement
- This project understands how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course.


### 2) Data Collection
- Dataset Source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977
- The data consists of 8 column and 1000 rows.

Our student performance prediction model has achieved a remarkable R-squared value of 0.8803.
This strong performance allows us to identify students who might need additional support or predict areas where they might excel. This information can be invaluable for educators by enabling proactive interventions and personalized learning strategies, ultimately promoting student success and improving overall academic outcomes.
